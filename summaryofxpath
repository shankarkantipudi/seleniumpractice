//Absolute xpath
		   /*its a complete path where it contains all tags
		    example: /html/body/header/div/div/div[2]/div/input 
		     -it will start from html and ends with element*/
		
		//relative xpath or partial xpath
		
		/*example://*[@id="search"]/input   
		 * we will prefer more because the nodes may change in absolute xpath but coming to relative xpath it will related and very close to element
		 * difference between absolute and relative xpath
		 * 1. absolute xpath  starts with single slash (/)
		 *   relative xpath starts with double slash(//)  
		 * 2. absolute xpath do not use attributes
		 *   relative xpath uses attributes 
		 * 3. absolute xpath traverse through each node till it finds element
		 *   relative xpath directly jumps and find element by using attribute */
                 Syntax: //tagname[@attribute='value'] or //tagname[@attribute=/"value"/]
